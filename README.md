MATLAB scripts used for delivery of TUS sonications for the experiments performed in the manuscript. 
Scripts are intended to be a template of randomized/blocked sonication sequences, as well as a way to easily randomize parameters to ensure experimenter/subject blinding. Randomization order is saved as a .xls file at the end of interleaved experimental protocols.

Please Note: These scripts are templates and require modification to suit the specific USB Port communciation protocol, transducer, and amplifier firmware of the end user.
