MATLAB scripts used for delivery of TUS sonications for the experiments performed in the manuscript
Scripts are intended to be a template of randomized/blocked sonication sequences, as well as a method of blinding the experimenter to randomized parameters, which are saved as a .xls file 

Note: These scripts require modification to suit the specific transducer, amplifier, and experimental protocol of the end user.
